# AstroSim

AstroSim is a real time astrophysics simulator that aims to simulate galaxies 
in a realist way. I was inspired by some of NASA's simulations on YouTube and
decided to make one to test myself.

## Technologies
- C++
- OpenGL
- glm
- GLEW
- GLFW
- Make

## Future Features (for now)
- Real time galaxy collisions
- Formation of new stars using gases

## Why This Project?
I am building this ambicious project as a portfolio piece, but to also
challenge myself as a developer and improve my software development skills.

## What do I aim to learn/improve from this project?
* Development of complex systems.
* The laws of astrophysics.
* Software development best practices.
* C++ modern features.
